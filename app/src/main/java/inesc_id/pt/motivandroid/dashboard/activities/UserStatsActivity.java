/**
 * UserStatsActivity
 *
 *  This activity lists statistics about the user usage regarding the multiple modes of transport.
 *  There are 4 different modes, according to the @param passed through keys.modeToDrawIntentKey:
 *
 *  - TIME_TRAVELED_USER_MODE = 0 (ratio of time travelled by the user, by mode of transport)
 *  - DISTANCE_TRAVELED_USER_MODE = 1 (ratio of distance travelled by the user, by mode of transport)
 *  - CO2_USER_MODE = 2 (ratio of co2 emissions by the user, by mode of transport)
 *  - CALORIES_USER_MODE = 3 (ratio of calories burnt by the user, by mode of transport)
 *
 *  The statistics data is passed through the @param keys.arrayStatsIntentKey
 *
 *  * (C) 2017-2020 - The Woorti app is a research (non-commercial) application that was
 * developed in the context of the European research project MoTiV (motivproject.eu). The
 * code was developed by partner INESC-ID with contributions in graphics design by partner
 * TIS. The Woorti app development was one of the outcomes of a Work Package of the MoTiV
 * project.
 * The Woorti app was originally intended as a tool to support data collection regarding
 * mobility patterns from city and country-wide campaigns and provide the data and user
 * management to campaign managers.
 *
 * The Woorti app development followed an agile approach taking into account ongoing
 * feedback of partners and testing users while continuing under development. This has
 * been carried out as an iterative process deploying new app versions. Along the
 * timeline, various previously unforeseen requirements were identified, some requirements
 * Were revised, there were requests for modifications, extensions, or new aspects in
 * functionality or interaction as found useful or interesting to campaign managers and
 * other project partners. Most stemmed naturally from the very usage and ongoing testing
 * of the Woorti app. Hence, code and data structures were successively revised in a
 * way not only to accommodate this but, also importantly, to maintain compatibility with
 * the functionality, data and data structures of previous versions of the app, as new
 * version roll-out was never done from scratch.
 * The code developed for the Woorti app is made available as open source, namely to
 * contribute to further research in the area of the MoTiV project, and the app also makes
 * use of open source components as detailed in the Woorti app license.
 * This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and
 * innovation programme under grant agreement No. 770145.
 * This file is part of the Woorti app referred to as SOFTWARE.
