// The classifier was trained in Python, using the ML algorithms defined in scikit-learn library. To be used on Android and iOS, the resulting 
// classifier was exported using 2 different formats, one for each operating system. 

// To be used in the Woorti app running on Android, the classifier was exported to the PMML format using the JPMML library. The JPMML library 
// allows to export the model to PMML format and to execute this model in Java that is then used in Android. 

// To be used in the woorti app running on iOS, the classifier was exported to the Core ML model format. The Core ML framework allows to export and // use the ML models on iOS devices. With JPMML and Core ML, it was possible to create the ML model in scikit-learn and then use that model on the 
// Android and iOS operating systems.

// Ln 54: RawDataPreProcessing is used to process raw gps and acceleration data into features used by classification algorithm.
// Locations array is used to store GPS points.
// Accelerations array is used to store accelerometer readings.
// New data (locations and accelerations) are continuously being inserted into corresponding arrays while they belong to the same segment.
// If a new data doesn't belong to the current segment:
// 1. All previously accumulated data is used to calculate segment features
// 2. This segment is evaluated and the corresponding result is stored in DawDataDetection instance
// 3. All locations and accelerations of evaluated segment are removed (except for the overlapping data that also belongs to the next segment)
// 4. New data is inserted into corresponding array
// Ln 60: timestamp corresponding to the first data (location or acceleration) of the segment.
